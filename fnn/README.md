# FNN (clone of CNN)

This front end focused Vite app, utilizing MUI for styling, is a recreation of the popular news site, CNN.

I wanted to utilized Vite and MUI together for the first time to create a clone of the front page (using components, scenes and widgets).

## Home Page

Recreated the CNN homepage with navigation bar, highlight bar, main articles (Big, medium, small) with different link types.

## Future Work

1. Create "Breaking News / Happening Now" banner
2. Create Cookies popup
3. Create footer directory
4. Logic for "More" in nav as a drop down
