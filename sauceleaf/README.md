# Sauceleaf

This is a website clone (+improvements) of a personal favorite restaurant in the local San Francisco area.

It is a pure frontend React app (with Vite), utilizing native CSS and JS, to view their restaurants information. The user has the ability to naivatgate throughout the home page (about, specials menu, contact etc) and look at a deeper menu specific page.

## Future Work

1. create specific Menu page
