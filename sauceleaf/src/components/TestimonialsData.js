      "Some of the best Pakistani/Indian food in the city. Up there with Guddu and Shalimar. The service is excellent and the food is delicious. The lamb biryani is wonderful - much better than other biryanis I've had. I also love the Karahi gosht, tikka masala and saag chana. The spices are just right and everything I've had here is great.",
